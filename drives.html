          Menstruation is a normal and healthy part of life for most women. A lack of information about menstruation and
          'taboos' that we have in society causes girls to miss out on normal childhood experiences and activities.
          The volunteers of Helping Hut spread awareness regarding the menstruation and importance of Sanitary pads
          usage instead of using dirty clothes, leaves , cotton and even sometimes ash .
          We distributed 500+ Sanitary pads in the slum areas to the women and adolescent girls.
          Many women even shared their experiences and troubles faced by them and appreciated our efforts which was
          visible through their relieved smiles .We hope to achieve much larger and better goals in future that can put
          smiles on the faces of people.

          There are many underprivileged, impoverished people who don't even have clothes to wear that are not torn off.
          We came across many such people who have been surviving in such poverty stricken conditions. To give an
          underprivileged person a pair of clothes is as good as dressing them with self respect. The Team Patna,
          Gwalior and Dwarka organised cloth distribution campaigns and distributed 500+clothes to the needy donated by
          our fellow volunteers and people to us.
          This effort of "The Helping Hut" endeavoured to bring some ray of hope in the lives of the needy.

          "Literacy in itself is no education. Literacy is not the end of education or even the beginning. By education
          I mean an all-round drawing out of the best in the child and man-body, mind and spirit." Said by Mahatma
          Gandhi. Education is everyone's right but still many children are not able to avail it because of the poor
          financial background. Helping Hut organised a stationary kit distribution drive where we distributed 1000+
          study kits to the underprivileged students in collaboration with NSS,DDUC. It was a beautiful experience by
          seeing those positive smiles on the faces of children. It is rightly said "To build a positive world, every
          country needs to educate children as it is the most powerful weapon and youth is the one that builds a
          nation".

          "The unequal distribution of food is one of the world's most tragic facts. Millions of people die because they
          have too little to eat, and many die because they have too much". -Laura Huxley.
          Food is the most basic necessity of any organism to survive. According to EPA in 2018, the commercial,
          institutional and residential sectors created an estimate *63.1 million tonnes of food being wasted. When we
          think that this particular food item is waste instead of dumping it we can give it to the starving section of
          society if the food is under the proper conditions to be edible. The country is currently combating the second
          wave of Covid 19 due to an unexpected increase in food insecurity and demand for free food for the poor. At
          this time Team Dwarka and
          Team Kota of Helping Hut reached out to the most vulnerable sections of society, namely daily wage labourers
          and farmers and distributed dry ration to them.Dry ration like rice, cooking oil, pulses, wheat flour was
          distributed by the team Kota and Dwarka in Village Kharija, Rajasthan on 26 May,2021 and in slum area near
          Dwarka sec 14 metro station on 31 October, 2021 respectively. We believe that everyone must help the needy
          ones as "We rise by lifting others' '.

          The sudden outbreak of Covid Pandemic sent the whole world into a whirlwind. Nationwide lockdown was imposed
          to break the chain of infection. Wearing a mask was made mandatory . "Mask will become symbol of a civilized
          society. If you want to protect yourselves and others from the covid infection the use of mask is important"
          addressed by PM Narendra Modi via radio programme Mann Ki Baat. So to ensure that the impoverished section of
          the society who can't afford these masks "The Helping Hut" came forward and distributed 500+ masks to the
          needy. We will stay safe if we focus on masking, self wellness, vaccination, and most importantly, our sense
          of community.

          Trees are one of the most important parts of our lives providing us with oxygen, preventing droughts, global
          warming etc. They make our lives beautiful but in return we destroy them by being greedy. The Helping Hut
          organised a tree plantation Campaign where we planted 500+ saplings in rural areas. We requested everyone to

          carry their bare body and don't even have blankets, leave the roof on their head and die adding to the counts
          of deaths in North India due to cold waves every year. The volunteers of Helping Hut stepped forward and
          provided a Helping hand to the poverty - stricken by distributing 100+ blankets to the needy ones. “We can't
