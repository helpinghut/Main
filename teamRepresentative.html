                      I have been working with Helping hut NGO from the past 1 year. When I think about the journey so far, it's been nothing less than a blessing. When I started volunteering I wasn't much aware of the working 
                      of social organizations, so everything was pretty new to me. I was talking and working with people from different spheres, places and backgrounds, which was indeed worthwhile. Working with helping hut has 
                      taught me to think about the society first and myself later. In a way volunteering has not only taught me about the various challenges in the society but it is also helping me improve myself as a person every 
                      single day. I find a lot of happiness doing my bit for the society. The joy that I got when I met the young kids full of enthusiasm was really soul touching. The sparkle of happiness in their eyes made my day memorable. 
                      I'm indeed lucky to have chosen volunteering. Had I not have been with helping hut, I don’t think I would have been the person that I am today.</span>

                        we meet people from different sections and children, especially where we interact and get to know their wishes and problems.
                       The highlight happens when a wish is fulfilled, and their eyes sparkle. Thanks to Helping Hut NGO for giving me
                        this learning experience and the opportunity to make a positive impact on our society.</span>

                    <p>Today, I want to share my beautiful experience of the journey of teaching unprivileged children. There is a favourite<span id="dots6">...</span><span id="more6"> quote of mine written by Bill Keane. Yesterday is history,
                       tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a gift from God, hence the name "present." Besides the usual things of food, care, love, clothes, etc. etc., education is a powerful tool with 
                       which they can build a solid foundation for their future. If you give them material gifts, they may last only for a little while! Knowledge and encouragement are the keys to their
                        success. I came to know about Helping Hut Ngo through one of my friends, and they recommended me to volunteer for it. The time I spent teaching the children has brought me closer to them. 
                        The way kids welcome me and enthusiastically wait every week to learn something new from me cheers me up very much. The only hope I can give them every day is to be proud and live a healthy
                         and fairly wealthy life. By seeing their condition sometimes, I forget a lot of my problems around them. There are many bright minds out there that are not able to pursue their education 
                         because of financial constraints. And as I experienced, I personally witnessed this problem because 7-9 of my students are very genius just because of a lack of awareness in their surroundings,
                          most importantly their parents. They don't even know the value of education in today’s world. I’ll try my best to help every child so that he or she can achieve his or her dream.</span>

                       those who are marginalized in society. These children suffer because of the poverty-stricken population's illiteracy. Education is the only gift people can utilize to 
                       make a better future for themselves. We may help them by contributing books and clothes, but we can also help them by offering education, which will prepare them for a 
                       better future. Helping Hut allows me to play a small part in their lives, which brings me great joy. I used to have a different attitude toward folks who begged for money 
                       when I was a youngster, but now that I'm older, I understand why. The right way to help society is by giving our bit through platforms like Helping Hut.</span>

                      Work for making some posters, sheets, etc., a person who is a lot of work always asks if you can do the task or not. If I'm busy, I say no. They say ok, no problem. Nobody is forcing

                      we are also happy to see the enthusiasm of the children that somewhere our hard work is being successful. When everyone works together as a team, nothing 
                      seems impossible, but it is a little difficult. But when we work as a team, everything goes smoothly. When we do any work together, everyone's energy level 
                      also increases. So it’s a great experience to work with Helping Hut.</span>

                      Hut is the best platform available. This is the area where I found true happiness and fulfilment, since I know deep down that I am finally doing something
                       worthwhile, something that provides smiles to those who are truly in need. Since joining, I've had the opportunity to meet with and work with people from

                      and over the last two years I have seen and experienced it all. You may not be interested in or bored with the same work at first, but when 
                      you see the results of your work and people around you becoming much more aware, you feel proud and excited to once again believe in your vision and work with the same zeal.
                       Helping Hut is not just an NGO where we help people who are in need, but we are trying to make the street children aware of education and provide them with all the facilities 
                      so that they don't go begging all their lives.
                      After completing two years with the organization, I have become a strong believer in teamwork. The kind of motivation, consistency, and discipline that you need comes
                       only from the team. I am looking forward to contributing much more and having a more positive impact on society through all that we can do as a team.</span>
