        <h5>Founder &amp; President</h5>
        <p>This beginning was a new beginning in my life which has put smiles on many faces. When I started this with some of my friends, there was a passion for working in everyone and I am very happy that they have kept their passion till now and hope that in the future also everyone unites with this passion and works tirelessly for the underprivileged children and beggars. Will work together and fulfill the purpose of this organization soon.

        <p>It has been a great experience working in an NGO right from the beginning when it started and how we few people discussed and worked on our plan initially and now expanding it to so many different cities all across India having volunteers in each of them is a sense of pride for all of us. It wouldn't have been possible without the constant guidance and support of Raghvendra who initiated it and made it happen.</p>

        <p> In the event that I need to depict my involvement with Helping Hut NGO in a single word it would be 'Healthy'. The fulfillment of rolling out a positive improvement in somebody's life merits each subsequent I committed in this association. By helping others through this NGO I turned out to be more altruistic than I at any point was.</p>
