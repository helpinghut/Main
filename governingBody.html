        <h5>Founder &amp; President</h5>
        <p>This beginning was a new beginning in my life which has put smiles on many faces. When I started this with some of my friends, there was a passion for working in everyone and I am very happy that they have kept their passion till now and hope that in the future also everyone unites with this passion and works tirelessly for the underprivileged children and beggars. Will work together and fulfill the purpose of this organization soon.

        <p>It has been a great experience working in an NGO right from the beginning when it started and how we few people discussed and worked on our plan initially and now expanding it to so many different cities all across India having volunteers in each of them is a sense of pride for all of us. It wouldn't have been possible without the constant guidance and support of Raghvendra who initiated it and made it happen.</p>

        <p> In the event that I need to depict my involvement with Helping Hut NGO in a single word it would be 'Healthy'. The fulfillment of rolling out a positive improvement in somebody's life merits each subsequent I committed in this association. By helping others through this NGO I turned out to be more altruistic than I at any point was.</p>

        <p>It feels great working with Helping Hut NGO. There is a different kind of relief. When we teach poor children, we are also happy to see the enthusiasm of the children that somewhere our hard work is being successful. When everyone works together as a team, nothing seems impossible, but it is a little difficult. But when we work as a team, everything goes smoothly. When we do any work together, everyone's energy level also increases. So itâ€™s a great experience to work with Helping Hut.

        <p>My NGO has completed two years of service to others. My experience is blossoming in this NGO. The great satisfaction is helping others & I am thankful to this NGO. We all saw the Corona time, which was very brutal for us, but I thank God for giving me a chance to be a member of this NGO. In this phase, me and my team mates help the needy ones. The focal point of this NGO is Udaan Street School, the initiative to give education to those children who want it, but due to some conditions, they will not be able to afford it. The great joy we yield while teaching those children. In fact, my experience is awesome & I hope this goes on and on.
