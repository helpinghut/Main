                    Knowledge is power, it's the greatest gift you can give to someone. You can uplift someone by helping them with money, shelter or food, but everything you could give to someone is temporary and will not last long enough. But when you educate someone with the best of your lifetime you are actually giving away a piece of yourselves and leaving a long lasting impression on their life.

                    Education is the greatest blessing one could receive. All worldly pleasures and amenities will fade away but the knowledge you impart on other people will always stay with them by shaping their life in a different manner.
                    
                    Keeping the same in mind the volunteers at Helping Hut NGO have contributed significantly to this knowledge sharing initiative- "UDAAN", the street school for underprivileged kids to help them get their fair share of education. Not everyone is lucky enough to have the blessing of education in their life. You can reach the greatest of heights in your career if you have good knowledge of your goals. This initiative has helped transform the lives of many children and helped them know the world around them better and make better choices for their future.
